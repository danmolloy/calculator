# FreeCodeCamp Javascript Calculator

[Live example](https://danmolloy.github.io/calculator)

By Daniel Molloy

This is a calculator created with react for FreeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries, following these [user stories](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator).

I used this project as an opportunity to use create-react-app for the first time, rather than building it in CodePen. I also spent some time further exploring CSS and creating multiple components.
