# FreeCodeCamp Javascript Calculator

[Live example](https://danmolloy.github.io/calculator)

By Daniel Molloy

I used this project as an opportunity to use create-react-app for the first time, rather than building it in CodePen.

This is my second attempt at the calculator. Improvements include:
- More attractive CSS design
- Mutliple react components
